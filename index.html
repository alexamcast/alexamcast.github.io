												<p>
													Analysis on trends, seasonality, and forecasting of police shootings with a dataset with information on daily shootings,
													as well as the ethnicity of the people that had been shot from 2015-2020. The data included six ethnical categories: White, Black, Hispanic,

										<button id="toggleButton2" onclick="myFunction('myDIV2')">Predicting Credit Card Fraud</button>
											<div id="myDIV2" style="display: none;">
												<p>
													Prediction and detection of credit card fraud from a dataset
													of 1000 observations of accounts that have at least one recently 
													declined charge and other demographic and account information. Methods
													for model selection are Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
													GAM's, Decisions Trees, and Random Forests and an implementation of a
													probability threshold of 0.25 to help with selecting the model that 
													overestimates the number of compromised credit cards to help minimize overall
													costs.
												</p>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/cardfraud.jpg" alt=""></a>
												<p>	The final chosen predictive model, out of a total of 15 models, was a Random Forest for the following model:
													fraud ∼ number of declines + age + amount. This model had an AUC (for both training and test sets) of 0.8919.</p>

													where the predictions are not to be higher than 10% of the true market prices so the houses sell.
													The data has 1587 known property transactions that took place in Taipei City and contains information about 
													each property including the transaction price, the district in which the building is located, the land and 
													building areas, the main building material, the numbers of rooms, hallways, and bathrooms, the year and month

													with the use of machine learning. The data used included information on 891 passengers of the
													titanic, which contains information about each individual passenger, including their ticket class
													(which is another measure of socioeconomic status), sex, age, the number of siblings, spouses, children,
													and parents they traveled with, assigned ticket number, passenger fare, cabin number, the port that they
													embarked from, and whether they survived the shipwreck or not. Models chosen were prediction accuracy oriented
													rather than an inferential.

													Analysis on variables relating to experiencing stroke and determining whether there are actionable steps
													one could take to reduce their risk of stroke. To evaluate the model's ability to predict stroke to that of 
													other potential stroke-predictor algorithms. The data used had approximately 25k people, 
													containing information potentially-relevant lifestyle variables. The data was split into a training set, 
													which additionally contained the stroke outcome meant to build our model on, and a testing set meant
													to test the accuracy of our model. These samples contained 15,303 and 10,204 observations respectively.

													The goal of this analysis is to ensure that at least 65% of students in the University Library are wearing a mask of
													surgical grade or better at any given time. If the requirement is not met, the data will allow the university to

													A total of 56,981 students participated and more than 19 variables were recorded for each of these students. 
													Before utilizing the data, it was cleaned to only include 19 variables. The data set was put together through a self-administered 
													questionnaire meant to obtain data on young people’s health behaviour and protective factors related to the leading causes of 
													morbidity and mortality. The variables were analyzed by their correlation with one another and the number of clusters were determined 
													with a scree plot.

									<h1>RESEARCH</h1>

								<h2>Multi-State Markov Modeling for Student Pathways</h2>
								<p>(Expected Completion: Summer 2024)</p>								
								<p>The importance of diversity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) has increased in the recent decades. 
									This has allowed for necessary collaboration, furthering the world's advancements in these fields. Diversity in STEM has been 
									difficult to achieve due to the lack of diversity in higher education (which has been historically observed, even today). To get a better 
									understanding of underrepresented student's successes, my research will track the pathways of students who are enrolled in 4-year universities. 
									More specifically, students who are enrolled in 4-year universities as a Math major, STEM major (but not Math), and non-STEM major will be observed 
									to investigate the retention and attrition of STEM majors at both a department level (in regards to Math students) and university level 
									(in regards to STEM and Non-STEM students). Prior to this investigation, knowledge of the types of enrollment mobility are crucial to proper 
									classification of the stages students may take along their academic journeys.
								</p>	

								<p>The dataset used to evaluate student pathways is the MIDFIELD dataset. This data set is a longitudinal data set made from a collection of 
									universities who are in partnership with MIDFIELD, containing records of student demographic information, academic records such as grades, 
									GPAs, and courses, and graduation records of degree attainment information for each student who had graduated from the institution that was 
									participating in the study. Like all statistical analysis involving massive datasets such as the MIDFIELD dataset, data cleaning, feature 
									engineering, and organization of the data was utilized to help with statistical analysis. A Multi-spell discrete-time approach is being utilized to 
									incorporate time-varying predictors and censoring which is beneficial when using longitudinal data to analyze mobility behaviours. 
									With the use of Multi-State Markov Models (MSM), we can easily describe how students move through a series of enrollment spells in the 
									continuous time frame recorded during the study.
