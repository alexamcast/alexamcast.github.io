													Analysis on trends, seasonality, and forecasting of police shootings with a dataset with information on daily shootings,
													as well as the ethnicity of the people that had been shot from 2015-2020. The data included six ethnical categories: White, Black, Hispanic,
													Asian, Native, and Other.

											<div id="myDIV2" style="display: none;">
												<p style="text-align: left;">
													Prediction and detection of credit card fraud from a dataset
													of 1000 observations of accounts that have at least one recently 
													declined charge and other demographic and account information. Methods
													for model selection are Logistic regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis,
													GAM's, Decisions Trees, and Random Forests and an implementation of a
													probability threshold of 0.25 to help with selecting the model that 
													overestimates the number of compromised credit cards to help minimize overall
													costs.
												</p>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/cardfraud.jpg" alt=""></a>
												<p style="text-align: left;">	The final chosen predictive model, out of a total of 15 models, was a Random Forest for the following model:
													fraud ∼ number of declines + age + amount. This model had an AUC (for both training and test sets) of 0.8919.</p>

											<div id="myDIV3" style="display: none;">
												<p style="text-align: left;">
													Prediction of housing price estimates for a collection of ten residential buildings to be sold in January 2020,
													where the predictions are not to be higher than 10% of the true market prices so the houses sell.
													The data has 1587 known property transactions that took place in Taipei City and contains information about 
													each property including the transaction price, the district in which the building is located, the land and 
													building areas, the main building material, the numbers of rooms, hallways, and bathrooms, the year and month 
													of the transaction, and the year the building was made.

												<p style="text-align: left;">
													The above plot shows the residuals vs fitted values. The red line is a scatterplot smoother and represents the average
													value of the residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted prices) for different fitted values.
													Since the red line trends above the middle dotted line (which represents zero error, a perfect prediction),
													this means the true values of the house prices are on average larger than our predicted prices. This plot
													suggests that our model tends be most accurate for smaller housing prices but tends to underestimate for
													bigger housing prices

													titanic, which contains information about each individual passenger, including their ticket class
													(which is another measure of socioeconomic status), sex, age, the number of siblings, spouses, children,
													and parents they traveled with, assigned ticket number, passenger fare, cabin number, the port that they
													embarked from, and whether they survived the shipwreck or not. Models chosen were prediction accuracy oriented
													rather than an inferential oriented. Variable data imputation was also necessary for some variables with missing information.

													other potential stroke-predictor algorithms. The data used had approximately 25k people,

													Before utilizing the data, it was cleaned to only include 19 variables. The data set was put together through a self-administered 
													questionnaire meant to obtain data on young people’s health behaviour and protective factors related to the leading causes of 
													morbidity and mortality. The variables were analyzed by their correlation with one another and the number of clusters were determined 
													with a scree plot.

								<h2 style="text-align: left;">Multi-State Markov Modeling for Student Pathways</h2>
								<p style="text-align: left;">(Expected Completion: December 2024)</p>								
								<p style="text-align: left;">Diversity in STEM has been difficult to achieve due to the lack of diversity in higher education. 
									A major contributor to the lack of diversity in STEM is the unevenness of student mobility for underserved students in STEM. 
									To get a better understanding of this diversity problem, this paper will track the pathways of students who are enrolled in 
									4-year universities with the use of multi-state Markov modeling. Prior to this investigation, knowledge of the types of 
									enrollment mobility patterns is crucial to properly classify the states of the Markov model through a continuous timeframe. 
									To approach student mobility with multi-state Markov modeling, states such as Math, STEM (Non-Math), and Non-STEM majors were 
									created as well as Graduated and Leave states. These states will help with the investigation of the retention and attrition 
									of STEM majors at both a department level (mathematics) and university level. Furthermore, variables chosen for this modeling 
									method will be selected to consider underserved students so that we can detect whether a relationship between an underserved 
									demographic and student mobility pathways exist.
								</p>	

								<p style="text-align: left;">The dataset used to evaluate student mobility pathways is the MIDFIELD dataset. This data set comes from a 
									longitudinal study from a collection of universities that are in partnership with MIDFIELD. MIDFIELD contains records of student demographic 
									information, academic records such as grades, GPA, and courses, and records of degree attainment information for each student who had 
									graduated from institutions that participated in the study. With the use of multi-state Markov modeling (MSM), we can describe how students 
									move through a series of states during their enrollment period and find the probability of them taking part in different student mobility 
									patterns based on the observed data from MIDFIELD.
